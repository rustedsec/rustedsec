Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m dedicated to creating open-source technologies that empower personal growth and transformation.

Iâ€™m also the founder of Phoenous, an organization focused on developing groundbreaking tools like brainwave entrainment software, AI-powered psychological assistants, and neural feedback devices.

Our mission is to make these innovations accessible to everyone. If youâ€™d like to support our work, you can contribute through our Ko-fi page, Open Collective, or Patreon.

Thank you for joining us on this journey to shape a brighter future! ðŸš€
